        <h2>Installation Process</h2>
        <h3>How Stylists Apply Genius Weft Hair Extensions</h3>
        <p>One of the reasons <strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong> are rising in popularity across the United States is their <strong>professional grade installation process</strong> that balances security with comfort and precision. When performed
            by a licensed stylist, the result is a seamless blend that looks and feels like natural hair.</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s a step by step overview of how <a href="https://kmxtend.com/products/genius-weft-hair-extenions-jet-black"><strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong></a> are professionally installed:</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Consultation and Color Matching</h3>
        <p>The process begins with a detailed consultation. Your stylist evaluates your natural hair texture, density, and length to determine how many rows of <strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong> you&rsquo;ll need. A precise color match ensures
            the wefts blend perfectly.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Sectioning and Row Placement</h3>
        <p>Your hair is sectioned into clean, horizontal rows. Depending on your hair type, the stylist will choose between <strong>beaded or braided anchors</strong> to create the foundation for sewing in the wefts.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Sewing in the Wefts</h3>
        <p>Using a curved needle and extension thread, the <strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong> are sewn securely into the anchored sections. Because the wefts can be cut safely, the stylist can trim them to fit the shape of your head allowing for
            <strong>flawless customization</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Step 4: Blending and Styling</h3>
        <p>After installation, the wefts are trimmed, blended, and styled with your natural hair. The result is a <strong>seamless, natural look</strong> that moves and feels like your own.</p>
        <h3>Installation Time</h3>
        <p>On average, the full process takes <strong>2 to 3 hours</strong>, depending on how many rows are applied.</p>
        <p>When installed properly, <strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong> provide long lasting wear, maximum comfort, and a completely natural appearance making them one of the most refined options available in U.S. salons.</p>
        <h2>Removal Process</h2>
        <h3>The Safe and Professional Way to Remove Genius Weft Hair Extensions</h3>
        <p>Proper removal of <strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong> is just as important as the installation. When done by a professional stylist, the process is quick, gentle, and leaves your natural hair healthy and intact. This safe removal is one
            of the key reasons clients are choosing this method over alternatives like tape ins or glued extensions.</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s how the removal process typically works:</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Identify the Anchor Rows</h3>
        <p>The stylist begins by locating the <strong>anchor points</strong> these are usually rows of micro beads or thread that held the <strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong> in place during installation.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Carefully Loosen the Wefts</h3>
        <p>Using professional pliers or scissors (depending on the anchoring method), the stylist <strong>loosens the beads or cuts the thread</strong> to release the wefts without pulling or damaging your natural hair.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Gentle Detangling</h3>
        <p>Once the extensions are removed, your stylist will <strong>gently detangle</strong> your natural hair and may recommend a light clarifying wash to remove any product buildup from the weft area.</p>
        <h3>Step 4: Clean and Store the Wefts</h3>
        <p>Because <strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong> are reusable, the stylist may <strong>clean and condition</strong> them for future use or reinstall them during the same appointment, depending on your maintenance cycle.</p>
        <h3>Time Required</h3>
        <p>Removal generally takes <strong>30 to 45 minutes</strong>, depending on the number of rows and the method used.</p>
        <p>The removal of <strong>genius weft hair extensions</strong> is non damaging, efficient, and stress free making them a salon favorite for long term wear and client satisfaction.</p>
